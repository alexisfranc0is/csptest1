        <h1>My Boston Terrier!</h1>
    
      <h1>Information about the breed:</h1>
  <p>Boston Terrier's have been popular for as long as I can remember. They were originally meant to be fighting dogs, which is
      odd because of their happy manner and size. Their "tuxedo-like" markings have earned them the name, "American Gentleman." Most
      Boston Terriers are very friendly and get along well with the people around them. </p>
  
  <h1>All about <i> my </i> Boston: </h1>
  <p> My Boston Terrier's name is Faith, but we only call her Babes now, and I got her when she was four years old. She was a very 
      successful show dog before we got her but you wouldn't know that, considering that we spoil her and she is kind of fat now.
      Babes is really lazy now and the only thing the really loves to do is sleep and eat. Even when we first got her if it was cold
      outside, there was no way we were going to get her out of the house for a walk. She loves heat and the sun. Anytime there is a
      patch of sun peaking through a window she will only lay in that patch, and as the sun moves, she will follow it. If we would 
      try to take her for a walk in the winter time, even with no rain, she would not budge when we pulled the leash.
