    <h2>More info:</h2>
    <p>The Boston Terrier's name is Faith, but we just call her Babes.
      I have had Babes since I was about 5 years old and she is the best dog ever.
    <p>The Goldendoodles name is Grace and we have had her for about 3 years.
      She is kind of annoying sometimes but she is also really cute.
    <p>Here is a photo of my dogs
